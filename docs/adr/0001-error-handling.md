# 0001. Error handling

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-22
- **Deciders:** mb6ockatf
- **Issue:** #2
- **Blocks:** #5, #6, #7, #8

## Context

Four people will write liborange, oranged and the client at the same
time. Without one rule for reporting failures, each of them invents a
style, and every boundary between their code needs a translation layer.
Decide once, before the 0.1 protocol code starts.

Forces and constraints:

- C++23 with GCC 14 / Clang 18 as the minimum; `std::expected` with
  monadic operations is available and checked by `ORANGE_CXX23`.
- liborange is a shared library (LGPL) with a public API in
  `lib/include/orange/`; what crosses that boundary is part of its ABI.
- XMPP defines its own error vocabulary: stream errors
  (RFC 6120 §4.9) and stanza errors (RFC 6120 §8.3).
- Most failures are expected: malformed or hostile input from the
  network, protocol violations, I/O errors.
- Standalone asio reports I/O errors as `std::error_code`.
- The concurrency model ([0002](0002-concurrency.md)) decides whether
  errors cross coroutine and thread boundaries.

Questions this ADR must answer:

- [x] #18 `std::expected<T, E>` for expected failures? What is `E`: one
  error enum per module, a shared `orange::error` type,
  `std::error_code`?
- [x] #19 Are exceptions allowed at all? Only for programming errors and
  out-of-memory? Never across the liborange API?
- [x] #20 How a protocol error becomes an XMPP stream error or stanza
  error, and who maps it.
- [x] #21 Logging: what gets logged where, and is there one logging
  interface?
- [x] #22 `assert` / contracts for invariants: on in release builds or
  not?

## Options considered

1. **`std::expected<T, E>` with one shared `orange::error` type.**
   - Pros: one vocabulary for the whole project; the type can carry
     any context we want (line numbers, the offending element).
   - Cons: one central file that every module edits; OS and asio
     errors must be wrapped before they fit.
2. **`std::expected<T, E>` with one error enum per module.**
   - Pros: each module owns its errors; easy to test.
   - Cons: the same errors are defined again in different modules;
     enums from different modules cannot be compared or passed
     through a common interface.
3. **`std::error_code` with a custom error category, without
   `std::expected`.**
   - Pros: classic UNIX errors; easy to understand; asio already
     uses it.
   - Cons: the result has to travel in an out parameter next to the
     error; an `error_code` holds only a number and a category, with
     no room for context.
4. **`std::expected<T, std::error_code>` with an error category per
   module.**
   - Pros: one return type everywhere; OS and asio errors pass
     through unchanged; each module still owns its enum; codes from
     different modules compare through `std::error_code`; monadic
     operations chain calls without nested checks.
   - Cons: boilerplate for every category; no context in the error
     itself.
5. **Exceptions for all failures.**
   - Pros: a clean happy path; constructors can fail.
   - Cons: hidden control flow; hostile input makes the server throw
     at the attacker's pace, which is slow; exceptions across the
     liborange shared library boundary bind its ABI to the compiler's
     runtime.
6. **Do nothing (each component chooses its own style).**
   - Cons: no unified style; hard to test; hard to document.

## Decision

We will return `std::expected<T, std::error_code>` from every function
that can fail in an expected way, with an error category per module
(option 4). An expected error never stops the system; it is returned to
the caller. For example:

```cpp
std::expected<orange::jid, std::error_code> parse_jid(std::string_view text);
```

OS errors pass through unchanged and keep their errno meaning. Protocol
errors use an error enum of their own module, such as
`orange::xml_errc`, `orange::jid_errc` or `orange::sasl_errc`,
registered with `std::is_error_code_enum`.

Crashes are not error codes, since nothing can handle them correctly:

- Out-of-memory (`std::bad_alloc`) is never caught locally. It
  propagates to `main`, which logs it, and the program exits.
- Programming errors are caught in two ways. Cheap internal checks use
  `assert`, which is compiled out of release builds
  (`./configure --disable-assert`). Invariants that protect memory
  safety, such as bounds on buffers, are checked explicitly and call
  `std::terminate` in every build.

Expected failures never throw. No exception other than `std::bad_alloc`
crosses the liborange API.

asio reports asynchronous I/O errors by throwing exceptions by default,
so always use `asio::as_tuple(asio::use_awaitable)`.

An error is logged once, by the function that detects it, because only
that function has the context (the input, the peer, the line). Callers
that only pass the `error_code` on do not log it again. Errors caused by
a remote peer are logged at debug level, so a hostile client cannot
flood the log. All logging goes through one interface, implemented in
#94.

Incomplete input, such as a stanza split across several reads, is never
an error; malformed or oversized input is. Input size is limited, and
the limits are tested.

For each error category, one function turns an `error_code` into an
RFC 6120 stream or stanza error condition; the stream layer calls it.
Modules never build XMPP error replies by hand.

This is the only option that gives four people one return type to
agree on without a central error type everyone edits. It keeps asio and
OS errors as they are, keeps exceptions away from hostile input and the
liborange ABI, and maps cleanly onto the XMPP error vocabulary in one
place.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** one way to report failure across liborange, oranged and
  the client; OS and asio errors need no wrapping; XMPP error replies
  are built in one place; hostile input never triggers an exception.
- **Negative:** every module writes the category boilerplate (the enum,
  the category class, `make_error_code`, the `is_error_code_enum`
  specialization). An `error_code` carries no context, so the detecting
  function must log it. Every asio call needs `as_tuple`, and callers
  check results explicitly.
- **Follow-ups:**
  - A short code example of the chosen pattern, which the socket-path
    code in `client/core/` follows (or is changed to follow).
  - The logging interface, implemented in #94.
  - `AC_HEADER_ASSERT` in `configure.ac`, so `--disable-assert` works;
    `config.h` is included before `<cassert>`.
  - Input size limits, set in the configuration
    ([0003](0003-configuration.md)).
- **Revisit when:** several modules need context next to the
  `error_code` (line numbers, offending elements), or C++26 contracts
  are available with the minimum compiler.
